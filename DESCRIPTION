Description: The data is first separated into m subsamples. Then for each subsample,
    we resample until we have the size of the original data r times, find the bootstap
    statistic(linear regression in this case), and compute the desired statistic(linear regression
    coefficients and residual standard deviation) from the bootstrap statistics. Then the average of 
    the m statistics are averaged.
